The website was in a state of disrepair, and it was clear that an upgrade was necessary. Users could only access some pages via Google search, and other pages were completely inaccessible.

To address these issues, a complete overhaul was undertaken. The website's outdated design was replaced with a fresh new look, making it more visually appealing and modern. The update also included a complete overhaul of the site's infrastructure, ensuring that all pages were accessible to users.

The new design makes the site easier to navigate, with intuitive menus and a streamlined layout. The site now functions as intended, with no broken links or inaccessible pages.

Overall, the website upgrade was a success, breathing new life into the site and providing users with a seamless, enjoyable experience.
